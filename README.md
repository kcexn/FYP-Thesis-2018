# This is my FYP Report for 2018
You will need a LaTeX compiler to build this.

I'm using the minted syntax highlighting package. Hence
you will need to use the -shell-escape flag and have Pygments 
installed to able to compile chapter 5.

Minted documentation at:
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/minted

## Windows

I'd try MikTex

## Linux

TexLive is pretty good

## Mac

I don't know probably a few options but Texlive 
is available for mac

# Sections that I'd like feedback

I'm leaving notes in here about things I am aware about
as I'm going through. The easiest way to provide feedback
is to either

- find me at uni and tell me
- email me at kcext1+evernote@student.monash.edu 
please include #Feedback_FYP 
at the end of the subject line.

## Overall

- I've probably made a whole bunch of spelling and grammar
errors. If you pick any up, highlighting them out to me and 
offering suggested replacements would be extremely appreciated.
you should be able to do this in any sensible pdf reader and 
attach it to an email to the above address.
- Generally speaking I'm aware that some of the figures
are a bit dodgy. They're photo scans from texts. 
- Some of the equations have some wack spacing. This 
is because I haven't gone through and inserted spaces or 
removed extra lines in places.
- I would highly appreciate feedback on flow and clarity. 
The document should make enough sense to you to at least 
fudge your way through even if you know nothing about wireless 
communication. So if parts are overly confusing or seem like 
they come out of nowhere. I'd appreciate it if you picked it 
up and let me know.

## Introduction

## OFDM

My first draft of this section is now complete
and should be completely readable as a whole.
It connects in with a section in the introduction 
on OFDM so these two parts should make sense together
as a whole.

## Wireless Channel Modeling

My first draft of this section is now complete.
I've also drafted up a section in the introduction
so these two should now be completely readable as a whole

Generally speaking I'm aware that some of the figures
are a bit dodgy. They're photo scans from texts.

## Adaptive Filtering

My first draft of this section is now complete

## System Design

## Results

## Conclusions and Future Directions
