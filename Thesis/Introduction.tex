\section{Motivating Scenario}
The next generation of wireless communication %
dubbed 5G makes promises of a hyper connected %
world with billions of devices coming online % TODO: cite this
connected by the radio network. With this kind %
of communication network in mind, it is easy %
to imagine a scenario in which a cell needs %
to serve many almost static users a steady stream %
of data over a long period of time.%

Figure \ref{fig:AppScene}. visualises the motivating %
scenario in mind of one base station serving many %
terminals over a bidirectional link. I'll be constraining %
% TODO: Add up-link study to the conclusion about future study
the study done within this report to simply the down-link % 
between the base station and a terminal. This link will %
have a few properties of interest to us. The first is that %
the terminal will be fairly static with very little movement, %
the second, is that the environment is prone to change. We can %
imagine this scenario as being a user, sitting down in a busy %
courtyard watching streaming video on their mobile phone. The %
user equipment is unlikely to move much however the environment %
connecting the user to the base station is prone to change as %
people and vehicles move about. I will model this environment %
as one that will introduce slow time-variations to the wireless %

channel connecting the station to the user. No more time will be %
spent analysing the validity of this channel model as %
the key focus of this report will be to analyse the %
effectiveness of adaptive filters under these channel %
conditions.

With this scenario in mind this report will be broken %
into the following sections. The rest of this chapter %
will aim to introduce the topics of the wireless %
communication principles used throughout the rest %
of the report, adaptive filtering, orthogonal %
frequency division multiplexing, and wireless %
channel modeling will receive a high level treatment %
here. Chapter 2 will give OFDM a more in-depth %
mathematical discussion. % This will probably be very short
% but I can probably flesh it out if I give it some 
% comparison and look at OOB emissions and the such.
Chapter 3 will give adaptive filtering a similar %
in-depth mathematical treatment. Chapter 4 will study %
channel models and channel modeling techniques. %
Chapter 5 will develop my system model both under %
under simulation and on the software defined radio. %
Chapter 6 will look at the results under simulation %
both on the radio and in MATLAB. Chapter 7 will draw %
some conclusions and make some remarks about future %
directions that can be explored.

\section{Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing %
(OFDM)}

The simplest way to modulate signals over the wireless %
channel is to use some form of single carrier modulation. %
Single carrier modulation simply takes input data, separates %
it into in-phase and quadrature components if necessary, pulse %
shapes the signal, up converts to the carrier frequency and %
transmits over the wireless channel.
%TODO: add figure to depict single carrier methodology

This method of modulation has some drawbacks. %TODO: find some 
% references that list some drawbacks of single carrier modulation.
The main drawbacks of interest to us will be the complexity of %
channel equalisation. The wireless propagation medium can be %
modeled as a finite impulse response filter %TODO: cite this
and so as the filter length increases estimating, %
the channel becomes an increasingly more complex task. %
A modulation technique that helps to overcome this challenge %
is orthogonal frequency division multiplexing or OFDM. %
OFDM works differently to traditional single carrier %
modulation in the sense that it separates the modulation %
bandwidth into $N$ subcarriers each with a subband bandwidth of %
$\frac{B_total}{N}$.

%TODO: add figure depicting the serial to parallel OFDM

A cyclic prefix can be added to the beginning of each OFDM %
symbol which gives it the nice mathematical properties %
which make equalisation simple regardless of the length %
of the channel filter. In addition, the parallel nature %
of the signal means that signal processing can happen %
on each subband independently and can reduce the bandwidth %
requirements for signal processing electronics.

The details of OFDM will be developed in Chapter 2. 
%TODO: fix chapter numbers
Where the mathematical construction of OFDM will be
explored as well as the nature of the cyclic prefix.

\section{Adaptive Filtering}

%TODO: Do some reading to find a good way to motivate Adaptive
% filters. Want to compare it to static filters at the 
% very least. Maybe even want to introduce some filter
% theory full stop.

\section{Channel Modeling}

%TODO: Do some reading to find a good way to motivate channel
% models. Want to introduce the wireless system model. And 
% connect the channel model to the idea of a filter. Connecting
% it to adaptive filtering and OFDM.
