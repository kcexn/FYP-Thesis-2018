\chapter{System Design}

Here I will develop my system model. Two separate designs were %
developed as part of my proof of concept. The first was a %
computer simulation designed in MATLAB, the second was a %
proof of concept developed on the National Instruments %
Universal Software Radio Platform (USRP) % TODO:include the model no.


\section{Time Invariant System Model}

%TODO: Carefully develop the MATLAB implementation

\section{Time Varying System Model}

%TODO: Carefully develop the MATLAB implementation

%NOTE: Rigourously justify every use of a MATLAB library function.

\section{USRP Implementation of the Time Varying System Model}

%TODO: Carefully develop the USRP implementation
