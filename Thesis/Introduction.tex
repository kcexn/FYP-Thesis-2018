\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}
Wireless communications systems suffer from a wide %
range of impairments that make the communications %
channel a hostile environment to communicate over. %
The convenience of wireless communication over %
wired communication drives demand for being able %
to accomodate for the wireless environment. %
As the internet of things becomes more ubiquitous %
it will be necessary to develop methods of %
equalisation and filtering that are well suited to the %
wireless channel and are robust enough to function %
on cheaper hardware. Here, the motivating %
scenario for the study done throughout this %
report will be developed as well as a surface level %
coverage of the three major theoretical components, %
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) %
Modulation, wireless channel modeling, and %
adaptive filtering. Chapters \ref{chap:OFDM}, %
\ref{chap:ChannelModeling}, and %
\ref{chap:AdaptiveFiltering} will give a more detailed %
coverage of the theory for OFDM, wireless channel %
modeling and adaptive filtering respectively.

\section{Motivating Scenario}
\label{sec:MotivatingScenario}
The next generation of wireless communication %
dubbed 5G makes promises of a densely connected %
network with numerous devices coming online % TODO: cite this
connected by the radio network \cite{Demestichas13,Hossain15}. %
With this kind of communication network in mind, it is easy %
to imagine a scenario in which a cell needs %
to serve many near static users a steady stream %
of data over a long period of time.%

	\label{fig:AppScene}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:AppScene}. visualises the motivating %
scenario in mind of one base station serving many %
terminals over a bidirectional link. I'll be constraining %
the study done within this report to simply the down-link % 
between the base station and a terminal. This link will %
have a few properties of interest to us. The first is that %
the terminal will be nearly static with very little movement, %
the second, is that the environment is prone to change. We can %
imagine this scenario as being a user, sitting down in a busy %
courtyard watching streaming video on their mobile phone. The %
user equipment is unlikely to move much however the environment %
connecting the user to the base station is prone to change as %
people and vehicles move about. I will model this environment %
as one that will introduce slow time-variations to the wireless %
channel connecting the station to the user. Although this %
particular example is an oversimiplification of how streaming %
video works over standard communication protocols, the idea %
of internet of things (IoT) devices needing to operate in %
slowly time varying conditions efficiently is not too far %
of a stretch from this simple example.

\section{Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing %
(OFDM)}

The simplest way to modulate signals over the wireless %
channel is to use some form of single carrier modulation. %
Single carrier modulation simply takes input data, separates %
it into in-phase and quadrature components if necessary, pulse %
shapes the signal, up converts to the carrier frequency and %
transmits over the wireless channel.
%TODO: add figure to depict single carrier methodology

This method of modulation has some drawbacks. %TODO: find some 
% references that list some drawbacks of single carrier modulation.
The main drawbacks of interest to us will be the complexity of %
channel equalisation. The wireless propagation medium can be %
modeled as a finite impulse response filter %TODO: cite this
and so as the filter length increases estimating, %
the channel becomes an increasingly more complex task. %
A modulation technique that helps to overcome this challenge %
is orthogonal frequency division multiplexing or OFDM. %
OFDM works differently to traditional single carrier %
modulation in the sense that it separates the modulation %
bandwidth into $N$ subcarriers each with a subband bandwidth of %
$\frac{B_total}{N}$. A key advantage of these subcarriers in %
relation to the scenario in \ref{sec:MotivatingScenario} is that %
the the subbands of the OFDM subcarriers can be designed to %
be narrower than the coherence bandwidth of the time %
varying fading channel. More on coherence bandwidth will %
be covered in chapter \ref{chap:ChannelModeling}

%TODO: add figure depicting the serial to parallel OFDM

A cyclic prefix can be added to the beginning of each OFDM %
symbol which gives it the nice mathematical properties %
which make equalisation simple regardless of the length %
of the channel filter. In addition, the parallel nature %
of the signal means that signal processing can happen %
on each subband independently and can reduce the bandwidth %
requirements for signal processing electronics.

The details of OFDM will be developed in Chapter 2. 
%TODO: fix chapter numbers
Where the mathematical construction of OFDM will be
explored as well as the nature of the cyclic prefix.

\section{Channel Modeling}

The wireless communication channel is a %
hostile environment. There are three %
major types of impairments that affect %
wireless communication

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Path loss}
	\item{Thermal electronic noise}
	\item{Fading}
\end{itemize}

Path loss is an impairment that affects %
all forms of electronic communication and is %
caused by the natural decay in amplitude %
that electromagnetic waves undergo as they %
propagate through free space. Path loss %
is proportional to $\frac{1}{d^2}$ where %
$d$ is the distance between the transmitter %
and receiver.

Thermal electronic noise is the noise %
caused by the electronics at the %
transmitter and receiver. The measure %
of thermal noise that is important %
will be the ratio between average %
signal power and average noise power %
commonly referred to as signal-to-%
noise ratio (SNR). The noise is %
commonly fixed by the temperature %
of operation for the electronics. %
The noise power spectral density %
is defined as %

\begin{align}
	N_{0} = \kappa T
\end{align}

where $\kappa$ is the boltzmann %
constant and $T$ is the temperature %
of operation in Kelvin. Noise %
power is typically relative constant %
in a given system and is defined as

\begin{align}
	\sigma^{2} = BT
\end{align}

where $B$ is the bandwidth of the %
signal of interest.

Fading is a stochastic impairment %
that is unique to wireless %
channels and is caused by obstructions %
in the surrounding environment, %
relative movement between the %
transmitter and receiver %
or movement of objects between %
the transmitter and receiver. The %
combination of movement and %
obstructions cause the wave to %
reflect and scatter throughout %
throughout the environment of %
interest before arriving %
at the receiver. This is a %
severe impairment to the wireless %
channel and is central to my %
analysis of adaptive filtering. So %
Chapter \ref{chap:ChannelModeling} %
will develop this in much more detail.

\section{Adaptive Filtering}

In the time varying scenario described earlier in %
section \ref{sec:MotivatingScenario} an single %
static estimate of the wireless channel impairments %
will not give the best equalisation performance as %
the channel will change. Adaptive filters offer a %
a way to track the changes in the wireless channel %
over time so that the optimal solution can be %
followed providing the best equalisation performance %
and minimising the number of bit errors in the received %
bit stream. The filters studied in this report will be %
the least mean square (LMS) filter and the %
normalized least mean square (NLMS) filter. Both %
are considered a member of the class of filters known %
as stochastic gradient filters which minimise mean square %
error by finding the stationary point of the paraboloid %
that defines the mean square error.

%TODO: Do some reading to find a good way to motivate Adaptive
% filters. Want to compare it to static filters at the 
% very least. Maybe even want to introduce some filter
% theory full stop.
