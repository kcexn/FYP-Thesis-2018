# This is my FYP Report for 2018
You will need a LaTeX compiler to build this.

## Windows

I'd try MikTex

## Linux

TexLive is pretty good

## Mac

I don't know probably a few options but Texlive 
is available for mac

# Sections that I'd like feedback

I'm leaving notes in here about things I am aware about
as I'm going through. The easiest way to provide feedback
is to either

- find me at uni and tell me
- email me at kcext1+evernote@student.monash.edu
in the subject line please include #Feedback_FYP 
at the end of the subject line.

## Overall

- I've probably made a whole bunch of spelling and grammar
errors. If you pick any up, highlighting them out to me and 
offering suggested replacements would be extremely appreciated.
you should be able to do this in any sensible pdf reader and 
attach it to an email to the above address.
- Generally speaking I'm aware that some of the figures
are a bit dodgy. They're photo scans from texts. 
- Some of the equations have some wack spacing. This 
is because I haven't gone through and inserted spaces or 
removed extra lines in places.

## Introduction

## OFDM

My first draft of this section is now complete
and should be completely readable as a whole.
It connects in with a section in the introduction 
on OFDM so these two parts should make sense together
as a whole.

## Wireless Channel Modeling

My first draft of this section is now complete.
I've also drafted up a section in the introduction
