# This is my FYP Report for 2018
You will need a LaTeX compiler to build this.

I'm using the minted syntax highlighting package. Hence
you will need to use the -shell-escape flag and have Pygments 
installed to able to compile chapter 5.

## Windows

I'd try MikTex

## Linux

TexLive is pretty good

## Mac

I don't know probably a few options but Texlive 
is available for mac

## Acknowledgements

This is the final version. I appreciate everyone who has offered me 
feedback up until this point, particularly those in and around the SMEE 
lounge who have put in effort to try and parse this document. Thanks to my 
girlfriend for putting up with all the neurotic moments that putting this 
document together has involved.
