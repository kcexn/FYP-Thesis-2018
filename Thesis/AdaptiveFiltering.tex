\chapter{Adaptive Filtering}

The previous section on wireless channel modeling established %
the wireless channel as a type of FIR filter. The aim of the %
receiver is to undo the effects of the channel filter. %

%TODO: insert diagram of the channel filter followed by
% an equalising filter

%TODO: provide a mathematical description of this equalisation
% effect

Throughout this entire chapter my development of adaptive filters %
will quite closely follow \cite{Hay02}. I'll start by %
developing the zero-forcing solution and the minimum mean square %
error solution also known as the Wiener solution. I'll then develop %
the stochastic gradient and the least mean square solution. A brief %
development of the recursive least square will be covered here as %
well.
